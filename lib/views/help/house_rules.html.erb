  <h2> How we expect people to use and behave on the site </h2>
  <p>
    If you violate any of the following rules we will likely suspend your account.
    This means you will no longer be able to make requests or
    updates on <%= site_name %>. We don't want to see you go, so we encourage
    you to follow these rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, breaking these rules could lead to legal action being taken
    against you by the authorities or an aggrieved party.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, if you break the rules it takes significant amounts of volunteer time to
    deal with and risks our ability to run the service.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use <%= site_name %> only to request specific information, not for general
      correspondence with public authorities, and certainly not for
      correspondence about your own personal circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not include potentially defamatory/potential libellous comments (such
      as allegations) in your requests and annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not post information that is unlawful, harassing, defamatory, abusive,
      threatening, harmful, obscene, discriminatory or profane.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not use <%= site_name %> to request your personal information from
      authorities. You should request this information directly from the authority.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep messages sent via our service concise and tightly focused on the
      subject of the request for information. Heed our
      <%= link_to help_requesting_path(anchor: 'responsible') do -%>
        advice on making responsible and effective requests.
      <% end %>
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not try to impersonate someone else.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not use any language likely to offend in your requests and annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      No spamming.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not make vexatious requests (requests with no serious purpose, or which
      are intended to disrupt the operation of a public body). The Office of
      the Australian Information Commissioner has
      <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-guidelines/part-12-vexatious-applicant-declarations#grounds-for-declaration">
      published guidance on vexatious behaviour</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not use our service to request other peopleâ€™s personal information and
      do not include such information in requests, annotations or follow-ups.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not try to evade the actions of site administrators by, for example,
      creating new accounts to evade a ban, or a rate-limiting cap, or by
      republishing material which you know has been removed by moderators.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By breaking these rules you risk being banned from using the site
    and your requests/annotations being removed. If we think we can give
    you some advice and how better to use the service we will contact you.

<li>
    Matthew Landauer, Henare Degan, Katherine Szuminska and Alexander Sadleir set up the software that runs Right To Know, collected and collated the information, adapted the help text and generally pushed, prodded and poked until things worked.
</li>
<li>
    Ben Fairless is a volunteer that almost single-handedly took care of the site administration for much of it's early life. He also played a big part in expanding Right To Know to cover states and territories along with Richard Taylor, who did a sterling job of collecting public authority information.
</li>
<li>
    Guy King's <a href="https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2012/09/25/accelerating-to-the-future-of-online-democracy-in-australia/">donation to the OpenAustralia Foundation</a>, made building and running this site possible.
</li>
<li>
    Our early testers, for checking over all the legal help text and making sure that things worked as expected.
    And since our launch, the amazingly helpful growing community of people that help each other on this site by leaving annotations on requests.
</li>
<li>
    Peter Timmins, Australia's foremost authority on Freedom of Information law, has kept us informed through the years with his indespensable blog <a href="http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com.au/">Open and Shut</a>.
</li>
<li>
    Everyone who has helped look up Freedom of Information email addresses.
</li>
<li>
    All the amazing <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/credits#thanks">staff and volunteers at mySociety, past and present, who created WhatDoTheyKnow.com</a> in the UK, which ultimately was spun out into the international software project <a href="http://alaveteli.org/">Alaveteli</a>, on which <%= site_name %> runs.

    Finally, all the officers who will and have answered the requests
    made through the site. Their diligence, patience and professionalism is
    what has actually made the information that you see here. Thank them for
    helping make Government more transparent.
